# CS326-Team-Project

Milestone 2: 
Our team project just needs to be run with npm run milestone-02. When you run it, it will prompt you to enter your name 
which will be stored in PouchDB. From there, you are free to interact with all of the views and data that is presented to you. Other
than that our application is very intuitive! 

Milestone 4: 
To run our project, use npm start to run.
