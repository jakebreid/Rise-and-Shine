            <br><h2>Overview: Rise and Shine!</h2>
            <section id = "overview">
             We are developing a highly personalized application that will serve as a morning organizer and day-starter, called Rise and Shine.
             Rise and Shine is a creative web application that prioritizes organization and productivity by combining multiple everyday morning routine activities, 
             such as to-do lists, Google Calendar integration, rising news stories, and suggested activities. 
            Think of Rise and Shine as your personal assistant to start your day off on the right foot. By encapsulating critical personalized information in one 
             centralized location, we provide the opportunity for users to keep their life organized and help kickstart their morning off in a fantastic mood. 
             As busy college students, we understand how critical it is to manage time and tasks, and thus, we want to create a cohesive personalized experience
             where users can view their tasks, schedule, and suggested activities for the day. This takes away the stress of managing your schedule, as well as provides
             unique and fun ideas on how users can spend their time, based on their interests. All in all, Rise and Shine will present users with a cohesive and organized 
             website that plans out their day, facilitating a productive and well-planned out day. 
           </section>

           <br><h2>Application Parts</h2>
           <section id = "application-parts">
            Within our Rise and Shine application we have included several critical components to help enhance the morning routine of the user. The Integrated Calendar is the first of these important components, providing users with a simple import for their personal Google calendars. On the Calendar View, users will be able to see what assignments, deadlines, appointments, and other upcoming events are approaching. This view will aid the user in starting their day with a purpose and guide them in the right direction from the morning forward.
	Another simple way in which Rise and Shine streamlines the user's morning routine is through its daily Weather information. Weather data will be fetched using the location data of the user—assuming permissions are granted. If the user prefers to deny access to location data then weather information will be fetched from an initial—static—location, provided during the account creation process. 
	A third component we employ to facilitate a productive and informed morning for the user is a Daily News section. This view will fetch breaking headlines from a wide variety of sources to give the user an array of choices for staying informed and being an active participant in current affairs. 
	Each of these components will not only be viewable from an individual view, for greater detail and interaction, but also through a smaller widget on the homepage of the application. Thus the user will be able to adjust their Rise and Shine experience each morning regarding the level of data they take in. 
           </section>
           <br><h2>Data Requirements</h2>
           <section id = "data-requirements">
                Our Data Requirements for this project are as follows: <br> <br>
                Location Data - dependent on user permission <br>
                Weather Data - ties to location <br>
                News Data <br>
                Spotify Data - permission <br> 
                Calendar Data - import <br>
                User Profiles- name, login/password(?), location <br>
                Game API - crossword and wordle <br>
                <br>
                
                Through Rise and Shine users will establish an organized and simple morning routine, eliminating the need to switch between applications. By providing all the information needed for a well informed start to the day our application acts as a hub for personal organization and planning. Our user’s profile provides the base data required to kickstart their morning routine. Upon the initial opening of Rise and Shine users will be prompted to provide a username, password, static “home” location, name, and date of birth. This data will be used to provide a friendly and inviting user interface, greeting the user by name and providing information about local weather and attractions.
                Another key data element that Rise and Shine relies upon to enhance the user experience is location data. This data will be used to fetch weather information based on the current location of the user, rather than the “home” location provided upon account creation. Location services will be enabled upon explicit user acceptance, and can then accurately provide information about weather and attractions in the local area. 
                We will use data from outside API sources. This will include a News API, to provide users with top informational headlines, and a Game API, such as the New York Times’s Wordle and Daily Mini, to provide users with entertainment options. 
                Integration of the user's Spotify data is another key personalization feature of our application. After receiving permission, users will be able to export their Spotify data, which will be used to pull key statistics from music streaming APIs. This data will be used to offer personalized recommendations, as well as information about the users recent listening habits. 
                Lastly, we will use data from a user's Google Calendar, smoothly importing and integrating this data into our interface. This allows users to meticulously manage their time while viewing other various aspects of the application. 
                Integrating multiple different data sources will provide a comprehensive and user-oriented overview to the application. This process allows for niche user personalization, enhancing the overall user experience.

           <br><h2>Wire Frames</h2>
           <section id = "wire-frames">
            <h3>Main Page</h3>
            <img src = "ui.jpg" alt = "ui" style="width: 325px;height: 300px;">
            <br>The framework of Rise and Shine has been designed to feature all of the information offered by our website in a grid-like format. Above all of the information provided to the user is a string accessing the information provided in the User Profile such as their name to present a “Good Morning [User's Name]” message. Under that in our first row is weather data and three featured news stories, under which is a preview to your calendar, frequently played spotify songs, if your spotify account is linked, and daily free games such as Wordle and the mini-crossword. Each of these boxes are simply previews, of which the user can click on any one to access more information.
            <br> <h3>Weather Page</h3>
            <br> <img src = "ui2.jpg" alt = "ui" style="width: 325px;height: 300px;">
            <br> The framework of the weather page would feature the location of the weather showcased in the top left corner, with the current temperature in the top center of the page, featuring an hourly forecast to the left and other important weather information such as wind speed, “feels like” temperatures, the current AV index and precipitation levels.
            <br> <h3>Calendar</h3>
            <br> <img src = "ui2.jpg" alt = "ui" style="width: 325px;height: 300px;">
            <br> Full page has a much larger view of the schedule for that day, with organized lines going down hourly from 12 am to 11 pm, and all events scheduled are featured within boxes with information that can be added like the location.
            <br> <h3>News</h3>
            <br> <img src = "ui3.jpg" alt = "ui" style="width: 325px;height: 300px;">
            <br> The larger news page view features more stories, with a featured top story, headlines and little pieces of the beginning of the article filling the space below the headline of each news story.

            <br><h2>Real World Connection</h2>
            <section id = "real-world">
                Rise and Shine provides a solution to a problem that many around the world find themselves struggling with, the lack of a quick and effective way to start your morning. Studies show that the more streamlined a morning routine is, the more likely it is that the rest of the day will be productive. Over the past decade or so, electronic devices have started to become a vital part of many people's morning routine, from accessing weather forecast information to checking important news stories. Unfortunately, most of this information is found scattered across many different applications and websites, and not in one convenient place, and that can lead to distractions coming in. Especially in my own personal experience, I can find myself getting distracted within my morning routine, finding myself on social media platforms I didn’t plan to go on but ended up spending way too much time on. Rise and Shine works to help prevent these possible distractions that can come from the wider internet to help users get all the information they need for a productive day in one spot, blocking out possible distractions to keep one's morning routine organized.
            </section>
            <br><h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
            <section id = "integrative-experience">
                The growth and application of Rise and Shine is a direct reflection and culmination of the Integrative Experience (IE).  Rise and Shine is a multidisciplinary collaborative application that emphasizes creativity and problem-solving skills. This project is specialized in the fields of computer science, psychology, and current events. We are combining user experience with multiple elements to create an project that addresses an issue: time management, organization, and productivity. Combining these elements fulfills the IE through its integration in cross studies, including experience in courses such as intro to psychology and a first year seminar about staying informed on current events through the news. 
	The other main IE aspect fulfilled is through the collaborative nature of developing Rise and Shine. As a team, we combine our various perspectives and life experiences and participate in an exchange of ideas in order to create our application. This united approach facilitates problem solving and teamwork. 
	Rise and Shine is a team-based educational experience that is a staple of the IE, based in real-world applications and formed through a combination of each member's academic and personal experiences and interests.
