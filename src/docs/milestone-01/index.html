            <br> such as to-do lists, Google Calendar integration, rising news stories, and suggested activities.

            <br> centralized location, we provide the opportunity for users to keep their life organized and help kickstart their morning off in a fantastic mood. 
            <br> As busy college students, we understand how critical it is to manage time and tasks, and thus, we want to create a cohesive personalized experience
            <br> where users can view their tasks, schedule, and suggested activities for the day. This takes away the stress of managing your schedule, as well as provides
            <br> unique and fun ideas on how users can spend their time, based on their interests. All in all, Rise and Shine will present users with a cohesive and organized 
            <br> website that plans out their day, facilitating a productive and well-planned out day.
